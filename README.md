Project Overview
The government of Spain was considering an expansion of it's renewable energy resource infrastructure investments. As such, they required information on the trends and patterns of the countries renewable sources and fossil fuel energy generation. 

In this project I was tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources. The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, was modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc. As with all data science projects, the provided features are rarely adequate predictors of the target variable. As such, I was required to perform feature engineering to ensure that I could accurately model Spain's three hourly shortfalls.
 

I carried out the following to meet the project's objective

Analysis of the supplied data;
identified potential errors in the data and clean the existing data set;
Determination of additional features can be added to enrich the data set;
building a model that is capable of forecasting the three hourly demand shortfalls;
Evaluation the accuracy of the best machine learning model;
Determination what features were most important in the modelâ€™s prediction decision, and
